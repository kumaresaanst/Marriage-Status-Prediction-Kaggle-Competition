# Marriage-Status-Prediction-Kaggle-Competition

This competition was hosted online by Kaggle and was solved by me to find put which algorithm works best in terms of both accuracy as well as being the best fit for this problem

The dataset contains 5 features - GAGE, BAGE, GP, BP and Annual Income where G - Girl B - Boy

Target is of 3 classes - Married, Separated, Divorced

The problem is to train the training set with features and its target to build a model function which can be applied on the testing set to predict their marriage status

As it is a classification problem due to discrete target, I have used many classifiers like Logistic, Decision Tree, KNN and also some ensemble algorithms like Random Forest and XGB Classifier

Go through the notebook file to find out which algorithm worked Best

Thank You
